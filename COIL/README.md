# Going Global

I created this website for a User Interface class at the community college I went to. I worked on a team, but only one other person knew how to code and was pretty busy. He helped with a few pages. I designed the overall website, the header, the footer and icons there, and edited the content on the homepage from the client we were working with. We did work with a client who worked at UW and I did work with a fellow student on interviewing him and she had some good input. We also did some user testing in this class. After the class was over, I worked to make the site responsive and created the logo during a short internship.
