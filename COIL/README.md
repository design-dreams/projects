# Going Global

I created this website for a User Interface class at the community college I went to. I worked on a team of four, but only one other person knew how to code and was pretty busy. He helped with a few pages. I designed and developed the overall website, the header, the footer and icons there, and edited the content on the homepage from the client we were working with. I also created a mock-up for the site on Illustrator. I did work with a fellow student on interviewing the client, figuring out the purpose of the site, writing up a proposal, and deciding where to put elements on the page. We also did some user testing in this class. After the class was over, I worked to make the site responsive and created the logo during a short internship.
