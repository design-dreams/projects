                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>GoingGlobalU enables university teachers to find each other worldwide and design student learning projects together as part of their regular classrooms. 
                University teachers complete profiles on themselves, then use this site to find other educators with matching interests. Adminstrators may use this site to aid teachers in finding each other and act as a resource in the forums. Projects can be created and searched as well. These projects are based on a well known approach called <a href="help.html">COIL</a> or Collaborative On-line International Learning, which has been used in hundreds of courses for many years.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>In the 1990’s, the internet opened up exciting new avenues for global communication, commerce and education.  No longer did we have to rely on travel to have meaningful, live conversations. We could learn and work together, but to communicate effectively when not face to face, required new ways of thinking and interacting to be successful. Many K-12 schools began to experiment with these new virtual tools to help students connect across countries and cultures, yet universities remained woefully behind. Yet universities are ripe for some of the richest dialogue and problem-solving educational activities. The skills needed in today’s work world, and in civil society to find solutions to the global issues we face require us to become highly competent in cross-cultural communication and virtual problem-solving.
                There is a growing demand among students and educators today to have our universities help students practice these skills across all subject areas. A key challenge has been to develop a tool to help educators in our universities efficiently find good matches for their students in the areas they teach. GoingGlobalU was developed in 2018 to address that need.</p>
