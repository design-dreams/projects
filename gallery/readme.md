# Pacific NW Photo Gallery

This is a site I created to experiment with designing a photo gallery. I used CSS Flexbox and JavaScript.

When I first developed this site, I used a JavaScript library as seen in index-old2.html for a school project.

Then I decided to see if I could create the lightbox with plain JavaScript and I was able to figure it out as seen in index-old3. The JavaScript is embedded in the HTML.

Finally, I cleaned up the HTML and the JavaScript, and created a separate file for the JavaScript (gallery.js). This version is seen in index.html.

All of the pictures in the gallery are pictures I took with my iPhone. I enjoy hiking and being outdoors.
