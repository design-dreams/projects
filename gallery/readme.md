# Pacific NW Photo Gallery

This is a site I created to experiment with creating a photo gallery.

I used CSS Flexbox and plain JavaScript. I orginally used a JavaScript library, but then I wanted to see if I could
create something similar with plain JavaScript. I was happy to find out that I could.

index.html is the newest version where I cleaned up the html and created a separate JavaScript file. The old html files are still in this folder as well. Would have been better to just use git. :) I just took a course on git on Treehouse, so I'm feeling more comfortable with it now. Woohoo!!
