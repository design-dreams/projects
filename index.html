                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <p>I used jQuery in this website, but I also created a plain JavaScript version that can be seen on
                    GitHub as well. They are used to
                    navigate the menu and also animate the header and nav up. All content is on one page this way.
                    I created
                    the Web Designer animation with Illustrator, basing it on a font I liked, then saving it as an SVG
                    and modifying the CSS in the file. It took awhile to create the
                    line, but creating the CSS in the SVG was pretty quick. I've played around with SVG's before and enjoy it.
                    I had an idea to make it look like
                    someone was writing Web Designer on the page and then figured out how to do it.</p>

                <h3>Pacific NW Photos</h3>
                <p>Gallery of photos I created using CSS Flexbox and plain JavaScript.
                    I really like CSS Flexbox and have used it in other projects. The original project was done with a
                    JavaScript library, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could do it with plain JavaScript.
                    I did it! You can see the other versions if you look on GitHub. It's explained in the ReadMe file.</p>

                <h3>Walking in Nature</h3>
                <p>This is the first website I created in school, but then I improved it after learning more. 
                    I added some CSS animation for selecting the hike, created SVG boot prints that appear in
                    the header when the screen is at least 960px wide, made it responsive, etc. I wrote all of
                    the content and took all of the pictures. The dots look best in Chrome.</p>

                <h3>Going Global</h3>
                <p>I created this website for a User Interface class at the community college I went to. I worked on a team,
                    but only one other person knew how to code and was pretty busy. He helped with a few pages. I designed 
                    the overall website, the header, the footer and icons there, and edited the content on the homepage
                    from the client we were working with. We did work
                    with a client who worked at UW and I did work with a fellow student on interviewing him and she had some
                    good input. We also did some user testing in this class. After the class was over, I worked to make 
                    the site responsive and created the logo during a short internship.</p>

                <h3>Responsive Web Design Projects</h3>
                <p>I created these projects to increase and cement my knowledge of responsive web design
                    and also attain a certificate from freeCodeCamp. There were some learning modules to go
                    through and then the projects with specific requirements by freeCodeCamp. I put the projects
                    on CodePen as suggested by freeCodeCamp.</p>

                <h3>Art Space</h3>
                <p>A project I did for school that is for children with colorful animation and an easter egg.
                     I used Greensock and haven't updated it.</p>
