                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <p>This is the site you are currently viewing. I used JavaScript, but I also created a
                    jQuery version that can be seen on GitHub as well. They are used to
                    navigate the menu and also animate the header and nav up. All content is on one page this way.
                    I created
                    the Web Designer animation with Illustrator, basing it on a font I liked, then saving it as an SVG
                    and modifying the CSS in the file. It took awhile to create the
                    line, but creating the CSS in the SVG was pretty quick. I've played around with SVG's before and enjoy it.
                    I had an idea to make it look like
                    someone was writing Web Designer on the page and then figured out how to do it.</p>

                <h3>Pacific NW Photos</h3>
                <p>Gallery of photos I created using CSS Flexbox and plain JavaScript.
                    I really like CSS Flexbox and have used it in other projects. The original project was done with a
                    JavaScript library, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could do it with plain JavaScript.
                    I did it! You can see the other versions if you look on GitHub. It's explained in the ReadMe file.</p>

                <h3>Walking in Nature</h3>
                <p>This is the first website I created at the community college I went to, but then I improved it
                    after learning more. 
                    I added some CSS animation for selecting the hike, created SVG boot prints that appear in
                    the header when the screen is at least 960px wide, made it responsive, etc. I wrote all of
                    the content and took all of the pictures. The dots look best in Chrome.</p>

                <h3>Responsive Web Design Projects</h3>
                <p>I created these projects to increase and cement my knowledge of responsive web design
                    and also attain a certificate from freeCodeCamp. There were some learning modules to go
                    through and then the projects with specific requirements by freeCodeCamp. I put the projects
                    on CodePen as suggested by freeCodeCamp.</p>

                <h3>Going Global</h3>
                <p>I created this website for a User Interface class at the community college I went to. I worked on a team of four,
                    but only one other person knew how to code and was pretty busy. He helped with a few pages. I designed and developed 
                    the overall website, the header, the footer and icons there, and edited the content on the homepage
                    from the client we were working with. I also created a mock-up for the site on Illustrator. I did work with a
                    fellow student on interviewing the client, figuring out the purpose of the site, writing up a proposal, and
                    deciding where to put elements on the page. We also did some user testing in this class. After the class was over, I worked to make 
                    the site responsive and created the logo during a short internship.</p>

                <h3>Art Space</h3>
                <p>A simple project I did for school that is for children with colorful animation and an easter egg.
                     I used Greensock, jQuery, and a CSS library.</p>

                <h3>What I'm looking for...</h3>
                <p>I'm looking for work in the Web Design field and am experienced with Front End Development.
                    I'm interested in work that involves any type of web design or web development work. I could
                    design a UI from scratch, or take an existing design and write the code for it, or both. I could improve
                    existing code or write web content.
                    I enjoy making websites aesthetically pleasing and useful. I'm willing to start out at miniumum wage
                    and work my way up. I could work full-time, part-time, as an intern, local or remote. I'd appreciate
                    your consideration as it's been difficult to find work in a field that wants 3+ years of work experience.
                    I'd like to start working as soon as possible and build on a career I enjoy.</p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I was raised in Orlando, FL, but I've lived on the Seattle Eastside for about 16 years now.
                    I enjoy hiking and being outdoors. I started dabbling with Web Design many years ago, but 
                    decided to have children instead of starting a career. I did work in the Engineering 
                    field for a few years, but I didn't like it. Web Design is so much more interesting to me.
                    There's always something to learn or create and the results can be seen quickly.
                </p>
