                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <p>This website! I used plain JavaScript so that the navigation menu could be used and display
                    the content accordingly. I also created a version in jQuery to show that I can use that as well. It can 
                    be seen on GitHub. The website is just one HTML page, which is why I used JavaScript. I created
                    the Web Designer animation with Illustrator, basing it on a font I liked, then saving it as an SVG
                    and modifying the CSS in the file. It took awhile to create the
                    line, but creating the CSS in the SVG was pretty quick. I've played around with SVG's before and enjoy it.
                    I had the idea to make it look like
                    someone was writing Web Designer on the page and then found some info, with a search, on how to do it.</p>

                <h3>Pacific NW Photos</h3>
                <p>Gallery of photos I created using CSS Flexbox and plain JavaScript.
                    I really like CSS Flexbox and have used it in other projects. The original project was done with a
                    JavaScript library, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could do it with plain JavaScript.
                    I did it! You can see the other versions if you look on GitHub. It's explained in the ReadMe file.</p>

                <h3>Walking in Nature</h3>
                <p>The first website I created in school, but then I improved it after learning more. I added some CSS animation for 
                    selecting the hike, created SVG boot prints that appear in the header when the screen is at least 960px wide,
                    and made some other tweaks. Looks best in Chrome.</p>

                <h3>Going Global</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Art Space</h3>
                <p>A project for school that is intended for children to use. I used Greensock.</p>
                <h3>Responsive Web Design Projects</h3>
                <p>I created these projects to increase and cement my knowledge of responsive web design
                    and also attain a certificate from freeCodeCamp. There were some learning modules to go
                    through and then the projects with specific requirements by freeCodeCamp. I put the projects
                    on CodePen as suggested by freeCodeCamp.</p>
