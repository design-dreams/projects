# Portfolio

These are all of the files for my portfolio, except index.html. That is in the root level project folder. The website is only one page.

I created both a plain JavaScript version and jQuery version that both work.

I created the Web Designer animation with Illustrator, basing it on a font I liked, then saving it as an SVG and modifying the CSS in the file. It took awhile to create the line, but creating the CSS in the SVG was pretty quick after watching a bit of video on Treehouse on how to do it. I've played around with SVG's before and enjoy it. I had an idea to make it look like someone was writing Web Designer on the page and then figured out how to do it.
