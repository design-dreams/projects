# Walking in Nature 

This is the first website I created in school, but then I improved it after learning more. I added some CSS animation for selecting the hike, created SVG boot prints that appear in the header when the screen is at least 960px wide, made it responsive, etc. I wrote all of the content and took all of the pictures. The dots look best in Chrome.
