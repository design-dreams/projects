            <dt>Trail information</dt>
            <dd>Located in Duvall, this trail is 5 miles round trip with some hills.
            Dogs are allowed. There is no bathroom at the trailhead. There are very
            few people on this trail. This trail has
            no markers, so here are the directions:
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a blue metal gate where the trail begins on Mountain View Drive near the corner.</li>
                    <li>Keep going straight for about 3/4 mile and there will be a bridge crossing Margaret Creek.
                    Cross the bridge and keep going straight.</li>
                    <li>After awhile, you'll come to a junction where you can only go left or right.
                        Turn left. On this part of the trail, you'll walk over stones in a shallow running creek.</li>
                    <li>Then there will be another junction and you'll turn right. A few minutes after you turn, you'll
                        see an old car. Keep going and you'll evenutally hear the falls off to your right.</li>
                </ol>
